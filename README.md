# Task-Scheduling-using-ACO-Algorithm
Using ant colony optimization algorithm for task scheduling of real time seystems with different cores counts and utilizations.
Task here made by uunifast algorithms and are periodic tasks with a deadline and execution time.
After the simulation we plot quality of service (QOS) and echedulability plots.
